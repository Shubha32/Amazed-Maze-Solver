# Amazed-Maze-Solver
Amazed?, a maze solver bot developed using Arduino traverses the optimal path from the source to the destination point using the left-hand rule algorithm. Efficiency in the algorithm has been captured by reducing the redundant and erroneous conditions caused due to the possible permutations and combinations of the line array sensors.
